"""Production points and production runs (conference-table build, Nick 2026-11-02).

  points    the numbered stickers on the table, each a production point: its label (the sticker's number), its spot
            on the table (from the site fit: clicked in the cameras' pictures), optional typed coordinates (a check).
            Saved per site in <conf_dir>/tagcal/points.json (tag_setup.py) and as spots in Mission Control's map.
  homes     the robots park near the table's middle, equidistant from it, HOME_GAP_CM apart (centre to centre), along
            the table's length, all facing the same way (+y). The middle is in both cameras' pictures.
  run       each robot: start-up (run_plan: calibrated since power-on? if not, it calibrates; calibrated today on this
            power-on: kept), then its production points in the order Nick chose, waiting DWELL_S on each (still
            readings for the external recorder), then home. The planner keeps the two 8 cm apart (the net); a point
            the robots cannot reach safely is moved in from the edge and said, never a stop.

  typed     (2026-11-03) a site may give its points typed (Jay's sticker sheet: sticker_points.py, the site's "points":
            {"use": "typed"}): the typed spots are the production points, the cameras or corner tags only fix the frame.
            "use": "clicked" is the old way (each sticker clicked), kept as the switch. The site also gives its edge
            room ("edge_in_cm"), its homes at named points ("homes": {"use": "points"}; "middle" = the old homes),
            keep-outs of its own ("keepouts": a raised box) and its default production orders ("production": zones
            per robot, nearest-neighbour order with 2-opt, or typed orders)
